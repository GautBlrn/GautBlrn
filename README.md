**Gautier Blairon's Portfolio**

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects showcasing my skills in big data analysis, machine learning, and technology-driven solutions. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or reach out to collaborate on exciting projects.

## Projects:

### 1. Big Data Analysis:
- **Mission: Automation**
  - This project aimed to automate the process of machine learning model training and evaluation. It takes a clean DataFrame as input, performs train-test split, and allows the user to choose from various algorithms for regression, classification, or clustering tasks.
  - Technologies/languages used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas
  - Insights: Enabled efficient comparison of different machine learning algorithms on a given dataset.

### 2. Machine Learning Applications:
- **Scraping Wikipedia Articles**
  - Scraped titles and URLs of high-quality articles in the French Wikipedia category, creating a DataFrame with ID, article title, article URL, and a boolean indicator for whether the article was read.
  - Technologies/languages used: Python, BeautifulSoup, pandas
  - Insights: Provided a structured dataset of Wikipedia articles for further analysis.

### 3. Technology-Driven Solutions:
- **Dashboard for Educational Data Analysis**
  - Created a dashboard using a BI tool (Power BI or Tableau) to visualize the distribution of highly aggregated educational fields based on location (Departments, Academies, Regions) for the year 2017. Shared the visualization link for public access.
  - Technologies/languages used: Power BI, Tableau
  - Benefits: Facilitated data-driven decision-making in the education sector by providing insightful visualizations of educational field distributions.

## Skills:

- **Machine Learning**: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Neural Networks
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Git, Jupyter Notebook
- **Other**: G Suite/Microsoft 365, meticulous attention to detail, rigorous, creative, self-contained
